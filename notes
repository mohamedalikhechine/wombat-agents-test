==============================
- ensuring nodes are added to wombat 
- ensuring the perftest node connected to rmq and working
- clean custom docker images
- clean the network
- add custom erlang version for erlang 17
- preparing wombat immediately after starting the container doesn't change the password ..it seems it needs more time till wombat starts


starting rmq in new versions # command: sh -c "rabbitmq-server"
